                  <p>Hi i'm Daniel verdú and i just enjoyed a lot making this app! this small and funny app its bringing all the characters form the 'superhero-api'. It has a search filter by super hero name, displays who is good and who is bad, when you click on a character creates a view wich is in a route and render this specific character.
                      Soon i will be updating the content adn trying to add more functionality, a battle be tween two characters maybe?
